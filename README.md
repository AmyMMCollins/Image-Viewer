# Image-Viewer

A very simple python program which goes back and forth between images. This code was developed while working on a k-means clustering GUI. 

I have many ideas which could be used in order to advance the code for instance:
1. Pulling the image paths directly from the image folder without having to manually create the imagepaths list.
2. When reaching the endpoints, jump to the opposite endpoint.
3. Work on the aesthetic of the GUI. 
4. Create an applet.

There is no real application that I can see with that this program so please let me know if you have any suggestions. Also, I am a novice at python so if you see a way I can improve the code please get in contact.
